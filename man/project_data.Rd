project_data(
  projector = NULL,
  projectee = NULL,
  ncells_coembedding = 5000,
  scale = FALSE,
  reduced_dim = "LSI",
  embedding = "UMAP",

}
\arguments{
\item{projector}{A \code{cell_data_set} or Seurat object containing a reduced dimension matrix (e.g., LSI) and the model used to generate a UMAP embedding.}

\item{projectee}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment}, \code{cell_data_set}, or Seurat object that will be projected into the UMAP space defined by the projector.}

\item{ncells_coembedding}{Numeric, the number of cells to use from the \code{projector} for co-embedding with the pseudo-single cells. Default is 5000, or the total number of cells if less than 5000.}

\item{scale}{Logical, whether to scale the projected data after projection. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{reduced_dim}{Character, specifies the reduced dimension method (e.g., "LSI" or "PCA"). Default is "LSI".}

\item{embedding}{Character, specifies the embedding type to be used (currently only "UMAP" supported). Default is "UMAP".}

\item{make_pseudo_single_cells}{Logical, whether to simulate pseudo-single cells from the \code{projectee} data, useful for bulk data. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{features}{Character vector, specifying whether the projection should be based on "annotation-based" or "range-based" features. Default is \code{c("annotation-based", "range-based")}.}

\item{n}{Integer, the number of subsampled "pseudo single cells" per bulk sample, relevant when \code{make_pseudo_single_cells} is \code{TRUE}. Default is 250.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to print verbose output during execution. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{threads}{Integer, the number of threads for parallel execution. Default is 6.}

\item{seed}{Integer, seed for reproducibility. Default is 2020.}

\item{force}{Logical, whether to continue even if the overlap ratio of features between the \code{projector} and \code{projectee} is below a certain threshold. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SimpleList} object containing the UMAP coordinates of the projected data (both original single-cell and simulated bulk data) and the reduced dimension matrix.
}
\description{
This function projects data from one single-cell object (or a similar structure) into the UMAP embedding of another object. The embedding must be precomputed using methods such as LSI or PCA. This allows for co-embedding of new data into an existing embedding space.
}
\details{
The function supports projections using models built from UMAP embeddings, which are ideal for comparing single-cell data, and can also simulate pseudo-single cells for bulk data. It is adapted from: \emph{ArchR: An integrative and scalable software package for single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis} by Granja et al. (2020).
